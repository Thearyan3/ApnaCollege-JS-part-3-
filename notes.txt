* Strings are Immutable in JS
--> No changes can be made to strings. 
Whenever we do try to make a change, a new string is created and old one remains same.

* Strings methods with Arguments 
Argument is some value that we pass to the method.

(i). indexOf - Returns the first index of occurrence of some value in string. Or gives -1 if not found. 
let str = "IloveCoding";
str.indexOf("love")   //1 

(ii). slice - Returns a part of the original string as a new string.
let str = "IloveCoding";
str.slice(5) //"Coding"

(iii). replace method - Searches a vale in the string & returns a new string with the value replaced.
let str = "IloveCoding";
str.replace("love", "do") //"IdoCoding"

(iv). repeat method - Returns a string with the number of copies of a string 
let str = "Mango";
str.repeat(3); //"MangoMangoMango"

* Method chaining - Using one method after another. Order of execution will be left to right.
